# 🚍 Bus/Transportation Tracker using Azure

## 📘 Overview
This project is a backend system designed to track public transportation (e.g., buses) using real-time or simulated GPS data. The GPS positions are stored in **Azure Table Storage**, allowing location updates and queries through RESTful APIs.

## 🧩 Features
- REST API for submitting and querying bus GPS data
- Azure Table Storage integration for persistent cloud storage
- GPS simulator for generating test data
- Clean modular structure with services and models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Flask (or FastAPI if used)
- Azure Data Tables SDK
- REST APIs
- Simulated GPS tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started
